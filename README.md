# GovardhanGovs7277
My name is Govardhan, and I'm a B.Tech student in Information Science and Engineering at Jain University, Bangalore, with a current CGPA of 9.0.

I'm passionate about technology and its impact on the world. This passion is reflected in my academic achievements, including projects like:

A social media login and registration system using Django framework with session management.


An API-integrated movie and TV show website.
A machine learning project predicting taxi trip durations.


Further, I honed my skills through internships at YBI Foundation and Capabl, focusing on data science and machine learning. 
My technical knowledge includes proficiency in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and the Django framework. Additionally, 
I hold certifications in these areas and have completed training courses in data analysis, machine learning, and full-stack web development.

Beyond academics, I actively contributed to my university by coordinating UX BLITZ, a UI/UX competition during our fest. 
I also organized workshops and sub-events to foster creativity among students.

In my personal time, I enjoy music, analyzing movies as a film enthusiast, and keeping myself updated with new technology and philosophy 
through YouTube interviews.
